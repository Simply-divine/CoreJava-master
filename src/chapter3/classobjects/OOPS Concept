It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

Object
Class
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation

Object is an instance of a class. Class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So object is the instance(result) of a class.

Class in Java
A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.

A class in Java can contain:

fields
methods
constructors

nested class and interface

Syntax to declare a class:
class <class_name>{
    field;
    method;
}
